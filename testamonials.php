      <h3>James and Linda</h3>
      <p>
        Yeates Painting painted the stucco on our housefor the previous owner
        well over 9 years ago and it still looks great and repels water. Mike
        did very fine work. We later hired him to paint the wood areas of our
        house and again he and his crew did very good work. They were quick,
        professional, priced fairly and cleaned up nicely after themselves. When
        it's time to paint again we will be calling Yeates Painting to do the
        work.
      </p>

        I have known and worked with Yeates Painting for eight years now. He has
        painted several areas in my home as well as, interior and exterior
        painting at our vacation home in Arizona. I call Mike and his crew
        whenever I have a client that requires painting during their
        renovations. His work is professional and precise. I wouldn't consider
        using any other contractor on my projects.

			<h3>Pat and Gabe Castro</h3>
			<p>
				We have known Mike and Heather from the Gate Church in Victorville for over a decade.
				When the time came to repaint our Master Bath and refresh our Oak Cabinets it was an easy decision 
				to call Yeates Painting.  Mike and Heather did a great job for us and took great care in taping
				off everything and cleanup was quick.  Yeates Painting delivered on their timeline as promissed
				and no surprises with the charges.  Highly recommend using Yeates Painting for any painting needs.
